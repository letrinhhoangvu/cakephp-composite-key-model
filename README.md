Composit key (multiple primary key) CakePHP 2.x model wrapper

CakePHP usually supports only one primary key and it works fine when we usually developing web applications.
But If you want to create crawler/bigger application you might be worry about CakePHP doesn't support.

I create one to share everyone.
It's very very alpha although, any help will be appliciated.
